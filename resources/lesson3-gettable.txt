##Get Table##  
Google Maps Engine stores data in tables, like the one below, where each column represents an attribute (Name, Country, Rating) and each row represents a feature. The attributes each have a name and a type which indicates what form the data takes (string, integer etc.). This information is stored in a _schema_, an example of which can be seen next to the table.

To see information about a table, including its schema, you can use a 'Get Table' request. The basic URL to make a 'Get Table' request for public data is:   
`https://www.googleapis.com/mapsengine/v1/tables/{tableID}?version=published&key={APIkey}`.

The parameter `version=published` is required to specify that a table is publicly accessible. If you have a table and wish to make it public, you can follow the instructions in [this link](//support.google.com/mapsengine/answer/3164737?hl=en). The parameter `key={APIkey}` is compulsory as a form of authentication in any public data request.

###Exercise###  
Copy the above URL into the input box below and replace `{tableID}` with this
ID from an existing table: `{publicTableId}` and `{APIkey}` with your API Key from the previous lesson.

##List Features##  
In addition to viewing a table's attributes, you can also request a list of the table's _features_ using a GET request. A feature is an entity that has some location, represented by geographical coordinates and other properties and stored as a row in the table. For example, a feature in the 'Famous Cities' table in the previous lesson would be a city.

The basic URL to request a features list is:  
`https://www.googleapis.com/mapsengine/v1/tables/{tableId}/features?version=published&key={APIkey}`.

###Exercise###  
Try to modify the URL above to list the features in the 'Famous Cities' table.
Use the table ID `{publicTableId}` and your valid API Key for the URL, then click 'Get'.

##Create Features II##  
The body of the POST request to create a feature has to be in the JSON format, where each feature is a GeoJSON feature. The body has to be a features array. From 1 to 50 features can be appended to a table in a single request. Each feature within the array must contain:

* `type`: The type of the feature, which is `Feature`.
* `geometry`: The geometry of the feature. The value might be null. If not, it must contain:
	* `type`: The type of the geometry. Supported types are `Point`, `LineString`, `Polygon`, and `GeometryCollection`. To read more about these types, you can read the documentation [here](//developers.google.com/maps-engine/documentation/reference/v1/tables/features#geometry-objects).
	* `coordinates`: The geographic position of the feature in the map. It might contain one or more positions. A position is an array containing a single longitude, a single latitude, and optionally a single altitude value, in that order. 
* `properties`: Contains one or more entries which conform to the target table's schema. It must contain:
	* `gx_id`: A unique identifier of each feature in the table. You can use any integer number for this but make sure that no other feature in the table has the same number.
	* other properties in table's schema. String and integer values must be enclosed in double quotes ("), while float values must not be enclosed in quotes.

###Exercise###  
Try to create a POST request body to insert *one* feature to your 'World Famous Mountains' table. We have created the URL and the header of the request for you so you do not need to modify them. The details of the feature is up to your liking, but remember that you have to follow the schema of the table. The body has to be a `features` array, with each feature containing:

* `type`
* `geometry` (including `type` and `coordinates`)
* `properties` (Including `gx_id`, `mountain_name`, and `height`)  
Remember that `gx_id`has to be unique, so do not use a `gx_id` that has been used by the features in your table. Also remember that the `height` property is an integer. You can refer to the body example in the previous lesson to create this body.

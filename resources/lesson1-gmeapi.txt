##Google Maps Engine API##  
Google Maps Engine hosts location-based data and allows you to access it in a number of ways, including a web API for reading and writing. The Google Maps Engine web API allows users to manage data using simple HTTP requests.

The two most commonly used HTTP methods for a request-response between a client and server are GET and POST. The GET method requests data from a specified resource while the POST method submits data to be processed to a specified resource.

In order to read data from Maps Engine, you send a standard HTTP GET request. This takes the form of a structured URL that uses paths and parameters, just the same as you would enter into your browser. The information requested is then returned to you in the HTTP response.

This is a breakdown of the structure of a URL:

If you want to learn several ways to send an HTTP request, you can read the documentation in [this link](//developers.google.com/maps-engine/documentation/hello-world).

###Exercise###  
Using the above template, structure the correct URL for an HTTP request to GET the file `alice-in-wonderland.txt` hosted at `mapsengine-api-tutorial.appspot.com` in the `resources` directory. Click the button to send the request and GET the file.

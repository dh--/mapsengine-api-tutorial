Congratulations! You have just added a feature in your 'World Famous Mountain' table. The server will not give you a response if you have successfully created a feature, but you can check it by going to the table the feature was added in the Maps Engine interface and selecting ‘Edit vector data’ from the left-hand navigation or by clicking [this link](//mapsengine.google.com/admin/?#RepositoryPlace:cid={userProjectId}&v=DETAIL_EDITOR&aid={userTableId}).
 
The feature you have just appended to the table is a representation of 'Mount Everest'. It has the height of 8848 m.

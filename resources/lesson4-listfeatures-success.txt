The response below is a collection of features in the [GeoJSON](//geojson.org) format. The response specifies the GeoJSON `type` (i.e., `FeatureCollection`), followed by the array of `features`, in this case, the cities. Each feature has a `type` (i.e., `Feature`), a `geometry`, and `properties`.

The response shown has a geometry `type` of `Point` since each feature represents a city whose location is specified as a single point on the surface of the Earth. The longitude and latitude of this point are displayed respectively in the `coordinates` array. The other attributes in the table are specified in `properties` and are specific to the data set. For example, in this table the schema contains `Name`, `Population`, and `gx_id`.

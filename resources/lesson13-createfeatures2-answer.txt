You can use this feature to add to your 'World Famous Mountains' table. You might need to change the `gx_id` to ensure that it is unique within the table.

`{
  "features": [
    {
      "type": "Feature",
      "geometry": {
        "type": "Point",
        "coordinates": [37.3533, -3.0758]
      },
      "properties": {
        "gx_id": "200",
        "mountain_name": "Mount Kilimanjaro",
        "height": "5895"
      }
    }
  ]
}`

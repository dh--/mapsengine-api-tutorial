##List Projects##  
In the previous lesson, we were able to request a list of your Maps Engine projects using an OAuth 2.0 token we received when you granted this app permissions. To list a userâ€™s projects, send a GET request for the URL `https://www.googleapis.com/mapsengine/v1/projects`. There are no parameters, keys or IDs required for this request. Instead, it must be accompanied by an OAuth 2.0 token carrying the appropriate permissions and identification.

In order to add this extra information, the request must have a _header_ which contains the token. Without the token, the API has no way of identifying which users' projects to return. In this way, this information is kept very private as only you can decide who can see it. If you want to verify that this information really is private, try typing the above URL into a new tab in your browser. You will see an error that this request is missing a header containing appropriate authorization information.

###Exercise###  
Enter the URL for a List Projects request into the box below. We have already completed the header for you, including the OAuth 2.0 token we got for accessing your project.

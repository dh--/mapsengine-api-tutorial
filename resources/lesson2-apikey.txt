##API Key##  
Before you can start interacting with the Google Maps Engine API, you will need an API key. It identifies you to the API and the Maps Engine API requires each user to have a unique API key in order to access data stored in Google Maps Engine projects. To obtain an API key, you will need to follow these steps:

1. You will need a Google account. If you do not already have one, go [here](//accounts.google.com/SignUp) and create an account.
2. Once you have signed up, go to the [Google Developers' Console](//cloud.google.com/console#/flows/enableapi?apiid=mapsengine) and sign in.
3. Select 'Create a new project' from the dropdown list and click 'Continue'.
4. Next, under Public API access, click the 'Create New Key' button to make your API key. Make sure you select 'Browser key' from the options then click 'Create'.
5. You should now see your API key, a long string similar to: `A9IaS9A7Rm1b9IsfSfFA_7RVpCo3_LMk7P2hlXX`.
